This is a compilation of my assignments in the Machine Learning course.
Some of it has errors and gaps.

The Naive Bayes has a large dataset, so I won't commit it here.
It is composed of 50000 (positive and negative each), with and without the topic to be predicted.

The RL Task solves the Cliff walking problem. Here is a good description: http://neuro.bstu.by/ai/2009-demin.pdf.

The Kmeans and EM have the dataset included. Running it will display and save the graphics.

The ensembles are just the scripts I used to explore ensembles. They are based in the examples of the sklearn project.
